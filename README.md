# **Rust Multithreaded Server**

## **Overview**
This project is a **multithreaded server implemented in Rust** that efficiently handles multiple client connections concurrently. The server was originally a **buggy single-threaded** implementation, and I have successfully transitioned it into a robust, concurrent architecture utilizing Rustâ€™s multithreading capabilities.

This repository includes **the solution steps** detailing the debugging process, concurrency improvements, and architectural enhancements. See [`SOLUTION.md`](SOLUTION.md) for a step-by-step breakdown of the work done.

## **Features**
- **Single-threaded and multithreaded server implementations**
- **Efficient handling of multiple client connections**
- **Thread-safe architecture using Rustâ€™s concurrency primitives**
- **Protobuf-based messaging protocol**
- **Comprehensive test suite for both single-threaded and multithreaded servers**

## **Used Technologies**
- **Rust** for system programming
- **Protobuf** for structured messaging
- **Concurrency primitives** (Threads, Mutex, Channels) for safe multithreading
- **Cargo** for package management
- **Logging & debugging tools** for error tracing

## **Solution Steps**
For a detailed breakdown of the solution, refer to [`SOLUTION.md`](SOLUTION.md). Below is a summary of the key enhancements:

### **Bug Fixes & Debugging**
   - Identified and resolved issues in the initial server implementation.
   - Used logging to trace errors and improve server reliability.

### **Implementing a Single-Threaded Round-Robin Server**
   - Ensured the single-threaded server could handle multiple clients using a non-blocking loop.
   - Implemented a round-robin strategy for handling requests.

### **Developing a Multithreaded Server**
   - Created a separate module (`multithreaded_server.rs`) to implement client handling using **multiple threads**.
   - Assigned **a dedicated thread to each client connection**, improving responsiveness and performance.
   
### **Concurrency Testing & Validation**
   - Added a dedicated test suite (`client_test_multithreading.rs`) to evaluate the performance and stability of the multithreaded server.
   - Verified that multiple clients can send and receive messages concurrently without race conditions.

### **Performance Enhancements & Documentation**
   - Measured performance improvements over the single-threaded implementation.
   - Documented findings and fixes in [`SOLUTION.md`](SOLUTION.md).

## **Installation & Setup**
### **Prerequisites**
- Rust (latest stable version recommended) â€“ [Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- `protoc` (Protocol Buffers compiler) â€“ [Protocol Buffers Guide](https://protobuf.dev/overview/)

### **Building the Project**
```bash
cargo build
```
This will compile the project and generate the required Protobuf message definitions.

### **Running Tests**
To test the implementation:
```bash
cargo test
```
To run tests sequentially (avoiding log interleaving issues):
```bash
cargo test -- --test-threads=1
```

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the **transition from a single-threaded server to a fully multithreaded concurrent server** in Rust. By addressing architectural flaws and implementing efficient concurrency mechanisms, the final solution achieves **scalability, thread safety, and improved performance**.
